The ArrayList class is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package.

The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java

* the size of an array cannot be modified (if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array, you have to create a new one).
* While elements can be added and removed from an ArrayList whenever you want.
* The syntax is also slightly different.

ArrayList

* Supports insertion order
* supports null values
* supports duplicate values
* init capacity is 10.
* formula to increase size : newSize = initCapacity * 1.5.
